Script 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd collates and harmonizes the output from GEE, 2_LSC2_secchi_matchup.Rmd creates the matchup files, X_LS4-7_LS8-9_handoff.Rmd is a quick model to aide in more transferable data between the two atmospheric correction methods.

Script 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd assumes that you have run the Landsat stack files in the 'landsat_c2' folder within this repository or have access to the Drive folder with the output created in those scripts. You will not be able to run this code if you have not completed the LS stack run or if the output has not been shared with you.

-   Filters applied: in 1_RS_collate_harmonize.Rmd, we've done the minimum filtering in 'Filter scene summaries' (dswe1 must be \> 10, IMAGE_QUALITY \>= 7). We may suggest to update this with new filters in the near future.

-   The files sameDay_LS-Secchi_matchups.csv, oneDay..., twoDay..., threeDay..., fiveDay... found in the data folder were created in the script 2_LSC2_secchi_matchup.Rmd 

-   We did not apply any Landsat 4-7/Landsat 8-9 handoff models. In the script X_LS_4-7_LS8-9_handoff.Rmd, we begin investigating that, but this will need additional work. See [Topp, et al 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abf002#artAbst).
